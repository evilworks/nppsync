# NppSync

**Note:** If you want something similar, but simple, there is a one script solution - [watchem.js](https://github.com/duzun/watchem.js).

A notepad++ plugin. Auto-refreshes Google Chrome tabs when their source has been modified in notepad++.

Npp plugin acts as a local server and returns file modification date for requested filenames or directories from Chrome extension. 
By default polling is done every second on `http://localhost:40500/`, but this can be changed in options page.

## Installing
- Put `NppSync.dll` in your plugins dir (either in appdata or in npp plugins subdir if you have a portable install)
- Install [NppSync](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nppsync/lnchindmhlepoocmobhlihmdpecckjhl) Chrome Extension
- Alternatively you can load the unpacked extension from `ChromeExtension` folder

## Building
You need Delphi XE2 on x86 Windows platform to build the npp plugin. 
Open NppSync.dpr and build.

## Usage
In Chrome open options page of the extension and under "Address Map" add new address. 
In the left input add an `http://` address (ex. `http://localhost/project/`).
In the right input add (local) filesystem path of the corresponding http address (ex. `D:\www\project\`).
Open any page under "`http://localhost/project/`" in Chrome and you will see an icon appears in OmniBox.
Red means disabled, Green - enabled. 
Click the icon to enable the extension then edit any source file from "`D:\www\project\`" folder in notepad++; Chrome auto-refreshes on changes.

`file:///` addresses are translated to filesystem path automatically!
